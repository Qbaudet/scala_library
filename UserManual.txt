This document provides a guide on how to interact with the Library Management System via its console-based menu interface. It outlines the functionalities available to different user roles: Member, Librarian, and Faculty, along with illustrative use case scenarios and console interaction examples.

1. System Overview
The Library Management System is designed to manage books, users, and borrowing transactions within a library. It supports three distinct user roles, each with specific permissions:

Member: Can borrow books, return books, and view available books.

Librarian: Has full control over books (create, delete), can manage members (create, delete, list), and handle borrowing/returning for members.

Faculty: Can view the list of members, add new members, and delete members.

2. How to Start and Navigate the System
Start the Application: Run the Scala application (sbt run)

Login: Upon startup, you will be prompted to login by entering your ID.

Welcome to the Library Management System!
Please enter your ID
If your account exist, you'll be logged in automatically
If not, you'll be redirected to the user creation page where you can create a new account. (See 'creating an account' part in this document)

Main Menu: Once logged in, you will see a main menu specific to your role. You interact by entering the number corresponding to your desired action and pressing Enter.

Prompts for Information: For actions requiring specific data (e.g., book ISBN, member name), the system will prompt you for the necessary information.

Returning to Menu: After most operations, the system will display a success/error message and return you to your role's main menu.
